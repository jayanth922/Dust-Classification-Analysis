you can go for random tile images in google or,
if you have ample amount of time,you can click photos from your mobile.
Make sure to have atleast 300 to 400 clean tile images and 
another 300 images of dirty tiles for sufficient training of data.
Make sure to split the data in to 70:30 ratio,ie,
70 percent data for training and 30% remaining data for testing.
Here i achieved an accuracy of 91%.
